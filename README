Data Structure Synthesis

This file documents how to use the data structure synthesis tool.

Detailed documentation lives in the "docs" folder. To build the PDFs:
    $ make -C docs

Dependencies:
    Python 2.7
    Z3 Python bindings

To run the tool:
    $ python src/main.py < FILE

Sample input files live in the "examples" folder.

The synthesizer will run pretty much forever trying to find a low-cost plan.
To stop it, press Ctrl+C and the tool will stop and output the best plan found
so far.
